Goal: Have terraform installed.

## Explanation

Terraform is a program that needs to be installed. It's quite simple, but required.

The Terraform CLI is a simple binary, no services/servers/daemon, no specific users, etc.

## Howto

This depends a bit on the environment you're working in.

- There are repositories for Linux (`apt`, `dnf` and `yum`).
- [Chocolatey works too](https://community.chocolatey.org/packages/terraform).
- You can [download the binary](https://releases.hashicorp.com/terraform/).
- To manage Azure infrastructure, you also need [azure-cli](https://pypi.org/project/azure-cli/). Follow [this guide](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/cli/azure/install-azure-cli-windows?tabs=azure-cli) for Windows computers.

Have a look at [this playground repository](https://github.com/robertdebock/terraform-playground) that can be used to spin up machine to try terraform on.
