Goal: Learn how to create Azure dbaas resources using Terraform.

## Explanation

There are many Azure resources available, lets setup a managed MySQL instance.

## Howto

Using the [azurerm_mysql_server](https://registry.terraform.io/providers/hashicorp/azurerm/latest/docs/resources/mysql_server), [azurerm_mysql_database](https://registry.terraform.io/providers/hashicorp/azurerm/latest/docs/resources/mysql_database) and [mysql_firewall_rule](https://registry.terraform.io/providers/hashicorp/azurerm/latest/docs/resources/mysql_firewall_rule) resources, we're going to create a managed MySQL instance.

## Demo

[Example code](https://github.com/robertdebock/terraform-azurerm-mysql-server)

## Assignment

### Easy

Use the [sample code](https://github.com/robertdebock/terraform-azurerm-mysql-server) and change these settings:

- [ ] Set the `administrator_login` to 'my_admin'.
- [ ] Set the `administrator_login_password` to `my_passw0rd.`
- [ ] Use a size of 10 GB.

You'll likely run into an error. Try to understand the issue and fix the problem. (Hint: `name`.)

### Hard

Use the documentation to make a firewall. Try not to look at the [sample code](https://github.com/robertdebock/terraform-azurerm-mysql-server), but if you're stuck, use it as *inspiration*.


### Testing things

Most machines have `telnet` installed: `telnet YOUR_FQDN 3306`.
Some machines have `mysql` installed: `mysql -u YOUR_USER -p -h YOUR_FQDN`.

## Questions

1. What are valid choises for `version`?
2. What happens if I change the `version` to this resource?
3. Could I make a virtual machine and install MySQL myself?
