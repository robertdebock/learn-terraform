## Assignment

Please tell something about yourself.

- [ ] Who are you?
- [ ] From 0 to 10, what's your experience with: git, cloud, infrastructure as code, terraform?
- [ ] What do you want to achieve? (Hint: Put this on a Post-itÂ®.)

## Terraform?

[HashiCorp on Terraform](https://www.terraform.io/):

> Terraform is an open-source infrastructure as code software tool that provides a consistent CLI workflow to manage hundreds of cloud services. Terraform codifies cloud APIs into declarative configuration files

Let's break that down:

- Open-source: You can view the [code](https://github.com/hashicorp/terraform). There is an [enterprise](https://www.terraform.io/docs/enterprise/index.html) and [cloud offering](https://www.terraform.io/docs/cloud/index.html) too, the "language" is freely available.
- Infrastructure as code: You can describe in [plain text](https://github.com/robertdebock/terraform-demo/blob/master/do.tf) what infrastructure you need.
- CLI workflow: From a Linux machines, you can use the `terraform` binary.
- Cloud services: Terraform describes "resources", which can be: machines, ip-addresses, loadbalancers, etc.
- Declarative configuration: You describe the infrastructure, Terraform will build (or destroy) it.

## How

- Please ask questions when you have them.
- Please keep your camera on regularly.
- If you run into issues, please share your screen to troubleshoot together.
- A typical chapter has an explanation, exercises and a summary.
- You can take a break whenever you need to, we'll try to take a break every hour or so.
