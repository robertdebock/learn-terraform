Goal: Get an account to play with Azure.

## Explanation

You need some kind of an account to use service on Azure. We'll setup an account that you can use to experiment safely.

You may use any account, but we'll experiment quite a bit, so have a separate account ensures you will not mix up production workloads with experiments.

You will need:

- A phone number.
- A credit card.
- A GitHub account.
